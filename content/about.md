I ain't sure what to tell about myself as we just met now. Knowing that you are intrigued about me, will let you in on a few kinks. But hoping that the relationship will last long, even though its one sided.

## What is this?

Website, duh!

To begin with, I enjoy talking about things I like, so this is where I ramble on. 

## Rambles?!

The rambles generally vary on different topics from DLL injection to hook Windows API calls to the perception of expanding universe to how delicious pasta is (fight me!).

Before we move on, I would like to point out that I ain't good at jokes - bear with it.

## The Real Deal

Very much in love with C++, as the power it encompasses is unbearable. Will be talking about it while going over different stuff like game hacking, function hooking, etc.

Typically a lazy yet curios man with so many toys to play with. Excited to make projects, but end up being lazy to write readmes. Planning to get deep into security, machine learning and back-end.

Customizing my Linux setups is one way I spend my free time :heart:.

## See you in the other side

I will be upholding the word of being volatile and add information about myself as the journey unfolds.
